[Book_Examples.ipynb](Book_Examples.ipynb) contains the tutorials and resulting visualizations of the chapter.

[Book_Visualizations.ipynb](Book_Visualizations.ipynb) contains programmatically generated figures for the chapter.

The generated figures are stored in [figures/](figures/) the movie through the 3D decision boundary volume is stored externally at:
