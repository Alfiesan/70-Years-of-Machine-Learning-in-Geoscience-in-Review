Code to recreate the tutorial and figures in the book chapter.
![Decision boundaries](/figures/decision-boundaries.png?raw=true "Decision Boundaries of different Classifiers")

[Book_Examples.ipynb](Book_Examples.ipynb) contains the tutorials and resulting visualizations of the chapter.

[Book_Visualizations.ipynb](Book_Visualizations.ipynb) contains programmatically generated figures for the chapter.

The generated figures are stored in [figures/](figures/) the movie through the 3D decision boundary volume is stored externally at:
